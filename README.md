# Installation

See [Install section](./INSTALL.md)  
Take the last release from [Releases](./releases)  
or see below for Beta versions

## Installation of Beta Version
If you clone this repository for upgrade, you will have all current developments (Beta) since the last release and you must modify the database if needed.
To do that check for the last ./update/sqlupdate_xxx.jsp file and inject the sql lines you will find inside that file, except the last one which changes the database version.
After that when upgrading from release, you must rollback those instructions for the upgrade process to perform without errors.

# Upgrade

Prepare the new adrezo directory with an upgraded version.

You must copy or modify some files from the actual version :
- log/ directory or let the application start new ones
- pictures/ directory if you store pictures locally
- WEB-INF/web.xml if needed
- WEB-INF/classes/adrezo.properties if needed
- WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml if needed
- WEB-INF/classes/quartz-config.xml if needed
- META-INF/context.xml

See the release notes to know if some of those files have their structure changed.  
If it is the case, you must put your configuration in those new files, otherwise you can just copy them.

Start the instance on this new directory.

If there is a difference in database version and application version, a page invites you to enter the admin password to proceed.  
After the upgrade, you are redirected to login page.
