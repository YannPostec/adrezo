<ul>
<li><img src="../../img/icon_delete.jpg" /> Delete the surnet</li>
<li><img src="../../img/icon_add.png" /> Add a child surnet to this surnet</li>
<li><img src="../../img/icon_modify.jpg" /> Modify surnet informations</li>
<li><img src="../../img/icon_database.png" /> Manage the subnet list of this surnet</li>
<li><img src="../../img/icon_calc.png" /> Compute available subnets in this surnet</li>
</ul>

<b>Be careful, it's a recursive delete within all subnets/surnets attached. However, there is no modifications to subnets</b>
<h3>Add</h3>

<ul>
<li>its IP</li>

<ul>
<li><img src="../../img/choice_right.png" /> From left to right</li>
<li><img src="../../img/choice_left.png" /> From right to left</li>
</ul>
