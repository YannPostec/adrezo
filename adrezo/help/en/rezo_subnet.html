<h2>Subnets Management</h2>
<p>With proper permissions, you can manage subnets.<hr />
On this page, you will find two zones :
<ul>
	<li>An Add zone</li>
	<li>the list of existing subnets with their informations</li>
</ul>
Within each line, you could :
<ul>
	<li>Delete a subnet when you click on <img src="../../img/icon_delete.jpg" alt="DeleteIcon" />. <b>Be careful, it will delete all associated objects.</b></li>
	<li>Modify a subnet when you click on <img src="../../img/icon_modify.jpg" alt="ModifyIcon" /></li>
</ul>
When adding entry, enter informations then click on <img src="../../img/icon_add2.png" alt="AddIcon" /> to validate.<br />
When modifying entry, modify informations then click on <img src="../../img/icon_valid.png" alt="ValidIcon" /> to validate.<br />
In both cases, you could click on <img src="../../img/icon_refuse.png" alt="ResetIcon" /> to cancel and go back to initial values.<hr />
A subnet is defined by many fields :
<ul>
	<li>its site</li>
	<li>its starting IP</li>
	<li>its subnet mask</li>
	<li>its name</li>
	<li>the gateway IP address (as information to the user)</li>
	<li>the broadcast IP address (as end limit to available IP search)</li>
	<li>its vlan ID if any. If none, choose ID 0 which means 'No vlan'</li>
</ul>
The broadcast IP address is calculated automatically when subnet ip and mask are entered.<br />
In case of add or modification, the ip/mask you entered are checked for subnet address validity.
</p>
<p>You could only display lines including the string entered in Search field</p>
