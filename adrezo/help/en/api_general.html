<h2>API Concepts</h2>

<h3>Authentication</h3>
To access API endpoints, you need to be authenticated.<br />
Authentication is only done upon local database.<br />
<p>URL : <b>GET /api/auth</b></p>
Example with curl :<br />
<pre>curl -k https://&lt;server ip&gt;/adrezo/api/auth --data-urlencode username=someuser --data-urlencode password=somepassword</pre>
This answer is your authentication token
<pre>{"sessionKey":"h6uoeo69n9r4io8r7la1uhu428"}</pre>
This token is valid during period defined with api.timeout in application properties file. Default value : 10mn<br />
Each time auth endpoint is called, the token is created, regenerated if expired or refreshed.
<p>The user must be declared as a normal user in local database.</p>

You must after retrieving the token put it into Authorization HTTP header of each request you make.<br />
The Authentication Scheme is : Adrezo<br />
Example with curl :
<pre>-H "Authorization: Adrezo h6uoeo69n9r4io8r7la1uhu428"</pre>

<h3>Authorization</h3>
Each API endpoint required some roles to be executed.<br />
When many roles are required, they must all be present in user rights.<br />
These roles are the same that those defined in application.<br />
In the role defined for the user, the API take into account the rights you defined for New Context.

<h3>Restriction to some subnets</h3>
By default, user can access all subnets in IP and Network operations.<br />
You can restrict this access to some subnets only, see Admin/API Management in help.
