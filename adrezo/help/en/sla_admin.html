<h2>NAS</h2>
<h3>Adrezo database feed</h3>
Data comes from  Cacti, many scheduled jobs inject data in adrezo database :
<ul>
<li>daily, adrezo database is filled with Cacti device list evolutions (CactiDevicesJob).<br />
New devices are added, those disappeared are marked as destroyed (keep in database for statistic), those marked as disable in Cacti are marked disable as well in adrezo.</li>
<li>hourly, daily or monthly as defined in CactiStatsJob, Cacti availability statistics are injected in adrezo and resetted in Cacti database.</li>
<li>data are aggregated from hours to days, from days to month (CactiAggregateHoursJob, CactiAggregateDaysJob) to have monthly statistics</li>
</ul>
